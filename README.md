## How it works
 Using the [OpenTDB API](https://opentdb.com/api_config.php), the game receives 10 questions at the start of the game.
 Each round, the game will type out a question, and present you with either True/False or Multiple Choice options.
 The quicker you answer, the more points you receive. Try to go for the highest score!

## Installation
 First you must create a setup similar to the image below (Position of monitor and speaker does not matter)

 Then enter the Advanced Computer, and enter `pastebin get GbHn0SkY triviaunite` into the terminal.
 
 Once it's been downloaded to your Computer, run the installer by entering `triviaunite` into the terminal.
 Your computer will download all the neccessary APIs, Images, and LUA files, and automatically reboot when it's done.
 After your Computer reboots, the monitor should now show the game and become fully functional!
